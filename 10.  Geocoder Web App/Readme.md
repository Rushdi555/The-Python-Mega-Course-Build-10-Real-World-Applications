# Geocoder Web APP

This is the last app and was a challange. The course shows how the website should function and look like. This was my take on the challange. 


## The Challange:
The website accepts a csv file that has and Address column. It then creates a new column showing the latitude and longitude of the Address. The user can then download the new file.

## My thoughts:
It was a fun little challange. Not hard yet not easy. Did it in about an hour. It gave me confidence considering the previous apps felt like I was only copying the code.
Now I'll start my next journey.

Thank you Ardit.
