# Data_analysis_python

* I first analysed the data in 'review.csv' using 'Analysis of 'reviews.csv'.ipynb' jupyter notebook
* Then I learned how to visualise the data using matplotlib at 'Visualisation.ipynb' jupyter notebook
* Lastly I learned how to make an interactive graph using justpy with Quasar and Highcharts framework
