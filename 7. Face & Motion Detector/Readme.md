# Face & Motion Detector

Created 2 scripts:

## Face_capture:
A script that detect human faces and shows it real time in the video using a greensquare

## capture:
A script that takes a picture of a background. It then detects if there is any movement in the video which it highlights in a green square.

It also shows the time an object enter and leaves the video in motion graph.html. This is done using bokeh.
